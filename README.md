# CMSDAS2020
Repository for BTaggingExercise for CMSDAS2020

The exercise shows the usage of BTagCalibrationReader standalone. 

## Installation
```
$export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700
$cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_18

$CMSSW_10_2_18/src/
$cmsenv

$git clone https://github.com/Soureek89/CMSDAS2020 CMSDAS2020/

$scram b -j9
$cd CMSDAS2020/BTaggingExercise/
```
## Running
The b-tagging calibration weight is calculated via the `BTagWeight` class defined in `BTagWeight.cc` using the efficiency histograms from `EffHistos/`

Selection.C runs selection criteria on the input samples and it is run using
```
$source process_all.sh
```
The job logs are stored in jobs/ directory.
  
The input sample Files can be found in `root://cms-xrd-global.cern.ch//store/user/smitra/CMSDAS2020/`

`make_plot.C` script can be used to check Data-MC comparison plots with 2 different b-tagging calibration methods, `discriminant reshaping (2b)` and `fixed WP-based calibration (1a)` from https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagSFMethods     
```
root -l make_plot.C(<variable-string-to-plot>, <calibration-tune-index>)
```
