# CMSDAS2020
Repository for BTaggingExercise for CMSDAS2020

The exercise shows the usage of BTagCalibrationReader standalone. Follow the following commands to run

export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700
cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_18

The b-tagging calibration weight is calculated via the BTagWeight class defined in BTagWeight.cc using the efficiency histograms from EffHistos/

Selection.C runs selection criteria on the input samples and it is run using

source process_all.sh

The job logs are stored in jobs/ directory.
  
The input Sample Files can be found in root://cms-xrd-global.cern.ch//store/user/smitra/CMSDAS2020/

make_plots.C script can be used to check Data-MC comparison plots with 2 different b-tagging calibration methods, namely discriminant reshaping (2b) and fixed WP-based (1a) calibration from https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagSFMethods
